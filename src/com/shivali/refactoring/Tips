1) Extracted methods should not have parameters that will be modified but should have parameters which are not modified exg: amountFor has amount.
2) Rename variables to some meaningful names.
3) In most cases a method should be on the object whose data it uses, thus the method should be moved to the
  rental from Customer
4) Temp variable thisAmount was assigned value once and use dt multiple places so we replaced it with method call rather than keeping the temp variable. Temps are often a
    problem in that they cause a lot of parameters to be passed around when they don't have to be.
5)The other temp used is frequentRenterPoints. In this case frequentRenterPoints does have a value beforehand. The body of the extracted method
  doesn't read the value, however, so we don't need to pass it in as a parameter as long as we use an appending assignment.
6)It is a bad idea to do a switch based on an attribute of another object. If you must use a switch statement, it should be on your own data, not
  on someone else's. Move that switch to property of class which its using.

8)I begin with Replace Type Code with State/Strategy. This first step is to use Self Encapsulate Field on the type code to ensure that all uses of the type code go through getting
  and setting methods.
